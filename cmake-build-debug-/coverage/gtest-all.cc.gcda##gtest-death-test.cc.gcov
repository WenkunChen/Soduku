        -:  612:// WindowsDeathTest implements death tests on Windows. Due to the
        -:  613:// specifics of starting new processes on Windows, death tests there are
        -:  614:// always threadsafe, and Google Test considers the
        -:  615:// --gtest_death_test_style=fast setting to be equivalent to
        -:  616:// --gtest_death_test_style=threadsafe there.
        -:  617://
        -:  618:// A few implementation notes:  Like the Linux version, the Windows
        -:  619:// implementation uses pipes for child-to-parent communication. But due to
        -:  620:// the specifics of pipes on Windows, some extra steps are required:
        -:  621://
        -:  622:// 1. The parent creates a communication pipe and stores handles to both
        -:  623://    ends of it.
        -:  624:// 2. The parent starts the child and provides it with the information
        -:  625://    necessary to acquire the handle to the write end of the pipe.
        -:  626:// 3. The child acquires the write end of the pipe and signals the parent
        -:  627://    using a Windows event.
        -:  628:// 4. Now the parent can release the write end of the pipe on its side. If
        -:  629://    this is done before step 3, the object's reference count goes down to
        -:  630://    0 and it is destroyed, preventing the child from acquiring it. The
        -:  631://    parent now has to release it, or read operations on the read end of
        -:  632://    the pipe will not return when the child terminates.
        -:  633:// 5. The parent reads child's output through the pipe (outcome code and
        -:  634://    any possible error messages) from the pipe, and its stderr and then
        -:  635://    determines whether to fail the test.
        -:  636://
        -:  637:// Note: to distinguish Win32 API calls from the local method and function
